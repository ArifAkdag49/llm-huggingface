Subject: Website Redesign Project - Progress Update

Hi Ali,

I would like to get an update on the current status of the website redesign project. We are approaching the final delivery date of June 30th and are satisfied with the work done so far. However, we believe some pages need to be revised.

Can we schedule a meeting to discuss this in detail?

Thanks,
John Doe
Acme Corp
